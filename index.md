Bridge is a technology platform designed to support biomedical research studies conducted though smartphones and other sensor devices. 

Bridge services support mobile registration and consent to participate in research studies, the design and scheduling of surveys and mobile sensor-driven activities, and the receipt of sensor and survey data from mobile sources. **[Explore our platform APIs.](/articles/introduction.html)**

Bridge SDKs are designed to integrate with the open source Research Kit (iPhone) and Research Stack (Android) frameworks to allow rapid and flexible development of research apps.

Bridge is developed and maintained by [Sage Bionetworks](http://sagebionetworks.org/mobile-health/), a not-for profit biomedical research institute active in the design, execution, and analysis of multiple mobile health studies. For technical support on Bridge or questions about this documentation please contact us at [bridge.info@sagebionetworks.org](mailto:bridge.info@sagebionetworks.org).
