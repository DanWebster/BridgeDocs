Bridge is a technology platform designed to support biomedical research studies conducted though smartphones and other sensor devices.

Bridge services support mobile registration and consent to participate in research studies, the design and scheduling of surveys and mobile sensor-driven activities, and the receipt of sensor and survey data from mobile sources.  Bridge SDKs are designed to integrate with the open source Research Kit (iPhone) and Research Stack (Android) frameworks.
