Bridge is a technology platform designed to support biomedical research studies conducted though smartphones and other sensor devices.  Bridge is developed and maintained by [Sage Bionetworks](http://sagebase.org/mobile-health/overview/), a not-for profit biomedical research institute active in the design, execution, and analysis of multiple mobile health studies. For technical support on Bridge or questions about this documentation please contact us at [bridge.info@sagebase.org](mailto:bridge.info@sagebase.org).

Bridge services support mobile registration and consent to participate in research studies, the design and scheduling of surveys and mobile sensor-driven activities, and the receipt of sensor and survey data from mobile sources.  Bridge provides a secure, compliant service that can accelerate the development and deployment of mobile apps in studies of human health.

Bridge SDKs are designed to integrate with the open source Research Kit (iPhone) and Research Stack (Android) frameworks to allow rapid and flexible development of research apps.
