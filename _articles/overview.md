Bridge Server is part of an open source technology platform maintained by [Sage Bionetworks] (http://sagebase.org).  Its purpose is to accellerate the development and deployment of studies of human health in which study participants provide data to researchers through mobile applications.  This site is intended as a technical resource for app developers.  However, there is much more to putting together a mobile health study than just developing an app - for more information please contact Sage Bionetworks.
