<p>Bridge Server is part of an open source technology platform maintained by [Sage Bionetworks] (http://sagebase.org).  Its purpose is to accelerate the development and deployment of IRB-approved research studies of human health conducted through mobile applications.  This site is intended as a technical resource for app developers.</p>

<p>Key components of Sage's platform are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="http://developer.sagebridge.org/articles/rest.html">Bridge Services</a> - A set of REST-based web services that allow mobile apps to receive study configuration such as surveys and task schedules, manage participant registration and consent, and securely receive participant data.  Bridge Server <a href="https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/BridgePF">source code is available in GitHub</a> - however Sage recommends developers use Sage's hosted services rather than manage their own server instance.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://developer.sagebridge.org/articles/ios.html">iOS and Research Kit SDKs</a> - Open source libraries for building mobile health apps using Bridge Services and Apple's Research Kit.
    </li>
	<li>
		<a href="http://developer.sagebridge.org/articles/android.html">Java and Android SDKs</a> - Open source libraries for building mobile health apps using Bridge Services and the open source Research Stack framework.
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="https://research.sagebridge.org/">Bridge Study Manager</a> - A web interface to Bridge Services allowing mobile app developers and research teams to manage and monitor their study.
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="https://synapse.org">Synapse</a> - An open source software platform that data scientists can use to carry out, track, and communicate their research in real time. Synapse has seeded a growing number of large scale biomedical research projects centered around genomic, clinical, imaging, mobile health, and other biomedical data sets.
	</li>
</ul>
</div>

Together, this platform provides the most complete set of support for the development, execution, and analysis of mobile health studies.
