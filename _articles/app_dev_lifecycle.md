## Customizing Bridge content for users

The Bridge server has a model for customizing the schedules, consents, and other information items that are returned from the server, based upon the individual participant. There are some specific criteria that can be used to filter server responses:

**The version of the application at the time of the request**<br>Through the use of our SDK, your application will send an HTTP header to Bridge that includes your application version. This can be used to filter content on the server.

**The data group tags assigned to a user**<br>DataGroup tags can be assigned to users to model any of a number of differences between users (anything short of information that would be identifying for an individual user, like an ID).

**The user's preferred language**<br>Information about the user's preferred language is sent in an HTTP header and saved as part of the user's profile. This language preference can be used to return localized content to a study participant.

These criteria can be used to select:

* The specific consent(s) that a user receives based on the subpopulations they are assigned to;
* The schedules that are used to create tasks for a user (and thus, the surveys or tasks the user will be asked to do in the app);

Using these primitives, Bridge can model a few different use cases:  

**Study Cohorts**<br>Individuals can be tagged with a data group during enrollment, and your study can filter consents, schedules, surveys and tasks based upon these cohorts. Cohorts can include control groups, underage participants, and more.

**Test Users**<br>Test or beta users can be tagged with a data group. Records in Synapse are exported with the userâ€™s data groups, so you can remove this test data from your final data set.

**Application releases**<br>You can hold back consent and scheduling changes by filtering them out of study content until a new app with a new version is downloaded by users. Test versions of the application, with the higher application version, can see these changes during your testing period.

**Localization**<br>Language differences can be used to return different consents, activities, and surveys to a user, or even change the study to meet different governance requirements for different locales.

## Initial Set-Up

In setting up the server for your study, you will:

* Create a Subpopulation for each class of consent you have in your study, defining the criteria for inclusion in that subpopulation (you start with a default consent group that everyone is required to agree to). These consents can be optional or required;

* Update the StudyConsents for your subpopulations to reflect your IRB-approved consent documents, publishing a version for each subpopulation when you are satisfied with your edits;

* Create Surveys and define task identifiers for tasks that are done in your app, publishing survey versions when you are satisfied with your edits;

* Create UploadSchemas for data you will upload to the Bridge server (surveys have schemas automatically generated when they are published, so normally this will only include non-survey tasks like tapping tasks, gait tests, etc.). These do not need to be published, since you will reference a specific revision of the schema in your data uploads;

* Create SchedulePlans that include Schedules for published surveys and task identifiers, filtered on the criteria described above, as needed;

Consents and surveys can be edited multiple times, and then a revision can be published when you have a final product. Surveys can have multiple published versions, but it is most commen to return the most recently published revision to users (the exact revision is recorded in the uploaded responses). 

Schemas are not published, but you always reference a specific revision of a schema in your application (it is "baked in" to your application code), so this is not necessary.

Schedules, email templates, and all other configuration settings are not versioned; they are immediately reflected in your study. **That includes subpopulation and schedule plan filtering criteria.**

## Subsequent app releases

After your first release, you will want to test changes while maintaining your production configuration. **The key to doing this is to use application version filtering to restrict new consents and schedules to the next version release of your application.** Consent groups/subpopulations allow you to restrict the application of the consent to your next application release. And schedules include a type of schedule, the criteria-based schedule plan, that can also be used to restrict new tasks to your next application release. This will prevent current users from seeing tasks, surveys, and new consent requirements until that version of the application is released to production. 

Similarly, you can make changes to existing schemas that are backwards compatible with any schema revision you are already using in production (data will not be sent to a different Synapse table, though columns may be added in that table and some columns may no longer be populated with data):

|Action|Description|
|---|---|
|Add non-required schema field|Always safe. You can start sending this data with your next release but the existing app is not required to send it.|
|Add required schema field|Set the min app version for this field to the next release version of your application. The next release will see this field (and will be required to send it).|
|Remove schema field (required or not)|Set the max app version for this field to the current release version of your application. The next release will not see the field (and should not send that data).|
|Change the name of a field|This is like a remove and then an add. You may need to set a max version on the old field, and create a new field with a min app version, in order to avoid creating a new revision of the schema.|

Finally, a new version of your app is released to the app store with a higher version number. As users download the app and requests start to include that version number, new app versions (and only new app versions) will see your changes during this transitional period.

## End-of-life for older versions of your app

It is not possible to force users to update their applications, so it is wise to leave older configuration for older app versions if at all possible. Over time, with subsequent revisions of operating systems and phone hardware, some users may even find they cannot update to newer versions of your app until they update their phone hardware.

However, when this is no longer tenable to maintain, you can adjust the minimum supported app version for your study, and app versions before this version will receive an error response from the server. The 410 HTTP response ("Gone") can be intercepted by your application and a message can be shown to the user that the app will no longer work until they upgrade. At this point, anything filtered only to those obsolete app versions can be deleted.

## Supporting studies without public registration

In some cases partners wish to register users without an email address. In these cases they typically assign a code of some kind that is entered into the app to register the phone. Participants are brought into the study outside of a public call for participation that involves downloading and registering through the app. In this case, 1) Sage Bionetworks has no information on participants, because 2) you assume full ownership of assigning the codes and tracking subjects in your study, including the re-identification of participants and contacting them further for any reason.

If this describes your study design, it's important to know how Bridge supports this set-up with a public API.

External IDs are first imported into the system. When a study is configured to manage these IDs, Bridge will not allow an account to be created without one, now will it allow a code to be used more than once. Bridge exports the external ID to Synapse as part of every record collected. This allows you to identify which participant submitted the data (only you have the mapping between the external ID and the participant it represents).

We then create a set of credentials (a fake email address and password) using this code so your application can authenticate with the Bridge server. Bridge uses the following pattern: if you enter the code ASDF, the server uses your support email address to create an email address (support+ASDF@yourorganization.com) and the password is the code (ASDF). (The support email address is configurable through the API as well as the Bridge Study Manager; although Bridge uses your support email address, it will not send documents to that address). When a code is entered into the app, it uses these credentials to authenticate with the server.

We must do this because the Bridge API is public and without authentication, anyone could submit data to your study. **It is important that your codes are as secure as a reasonably secure password.** A site like [How Secure Is My Password?](https://howsecureismypassword.net/) can help choose a format for your codes.

In the Bridge Study Manager, the Lab Codes section of the application combines this process. You import one or more codes and it will create both the external ID and the credentials.
