## Modeling some key study features

The Bridge server has been designed to customize the schedules, consents, and other information that the server returns, based upon the individual participant. There are some specific criteria that can be used to filter server responses:

**The operating system and application version of a user's request**<br>Through the use of our REST client, your application will send an HTTP header to Bridge that includes your application version.

**The data group tags assigned to a user**<br>Data group tags can be assigned to users to model any of a number of differences between users (anything short of information that would be identifying for an individual user, like an ID).

**The user's preferred language**<br>Information about the user's preferred language is sent in an HTTP header and saved as part of the user's profile. This language preference can be used to return localized content to a study participant.

**Important: filtering is "opt in". If these values are not sent in HTTP headers or set for the user, no filtering will occur.**

These criteria can be used to select:

* The specific consent(s) that a user receives based on the subpopulations they are assigned to;
* The schedules that are used to create tasks for a user (and thus, the surveys or tasks the user will be asked to do in the app);

Using these primitives, Bridge can model a few different use cases:  

**Study Cohorts**<br>Individuals can be tagged with a data group during enrollment, and your study can filter consents, schedules, surveys and tasks based upon these cohorts. Cohorts can include control groups, underage participants, and more.

**Test Users**<br>Test or beta users can be tagged with a data group. Records in Synapse are exported with the userâ€™s data groups, so you can remove this test data from your final data set. All studies have a `test_user` data group that can be used for this purpose.

**Application releases**<br>You can hold back consent and scheduling changes by filtering them out of study content until a new app with a new version is downloaded by users. Test versions of the application, with the higher application version, can see these changes during your testing period.

**Localization**<br>Language differences can be used to return different consents, activities, and surveys to a user, or even change the study to meet different governance requirements for different locales.

**Application end-of-life**<br>The application version can be used to force users to upgrade if their version of the app is no longer compatible with your study's evolving requirements.

## Initial Set-Up

In setting up the server for your study, you will:

* Create a subpopulation (or consent group) for each class of consent you have in your study, defining the criteria for inclusion in that subpopulation (you start with a default consent group that everyone is required to agree to). These consents can be optional or required;

* Update the study consents for your subpopulations to reflect your IRB-approved consent documents, publishing a version for each subpopulation when you are satisfied with your edits;

* Create surveys and define task identifiers for tasks that are done in your app, publishing survey versions when you are satisfied with your edits;

* Create upload schemas for data you will upload to the Bridge server (surveys have schemas automatically generated when they are published, so normally this will only include non-survey tasks like tapping tasks, gait tests, etc.). These do not need to be published, since you will reference a specific revision of the schema in your data uploads;

* Create schedule plans that include schedules for published surveys and task identifiers, filtered on the criteria described above, as needed;

Consents and surveys can be edited multiple times, and then a revision can be published when you have a final product. Surveys can have multiple published versions, but it is most common to return the most recently published revision to users (the exact revision is recorded in the uploaded responses). 

Schemas are not published, but you always reference a specific revision of a schema in your application (it is "baked in" to your application code), so this is not necessary.

Schedules, email templates, and all other configuration settings are not versioned; they are immediately reflected in your study. **That includes subpopulation and schedule plan filtering criteria.**

## Supporting studies without public registration

In some cases partners wish to register users without an email address. In these cases they typically assign a code of some kind that is entered into the app to register the phone. Participants are brought into the study outside of a public call for participation that involves downloading and registering through the app. In this case, 1) Sage Bionetworks has no information on participants, because 2) you assume full ownership of assigning the codes and tracking subjects in your study, including the re-identification of participants and contacting them further for any reason.

If this describes your study design, it's important to know how Bridge supports this set-up with a public API.

External IDs are first imported into the system. When a study is configured to manage these IDs, Bridge will not allow an account to be created without one, nor will it allow a code to be used more than once. Bridge exports the external ID to Synapse as part of every record collected. This allows you to identify which participant submitted the data (only your study has the mapping between the external ID and the participant it represents).

We then create a set of credentials (a fake email address and password) using this code so your application can authenticate with the Bridge server. Bridge uses the following pattern: if you enter the code ASDF, the server uses your support email address to create an email address (support+ASDF@yourorganization.com) and the password is the code (ASDF). (The support email address is configurable through the API as well as the Bridge Study Manager; although Bridge uses your support email address, it will not send documents to that address). When a code is entered into the app, it uses these credentials to authenticate with the server.

We must do this because the Bridge API is public and without authentication, anyone could submit data to your study. **It is important that your codes are as secure as a reasonably secure password.** A site like [How Secure Is My Password?](https://howsecureismypassword.net/) can help choose a format for your codes.
