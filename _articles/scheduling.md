<div id="toc"></div>

A [Schedule](/#Schedule) describes when a user will be asked by the Bridge server to perform activities. A scheduled activity describes an activity (task or survey) and a start and end time when the user should be prompted to perform that activity. A client application may use this information to inform the user about their ongoing participation in the study (e.g. to show that a task is coming up in 2 hours, or that it is currently in progress).

Tasks that have expired, or that have been updated with a `finishedOn` timestamp, are not returned by the server. The API allows you to retrieve the next few days of activities for a user, but this is adjustable (see the [scheduled activities API](/swagger-ui/index.html#!/Activities/getScheduledActivities)).

Schedules are generated by a  schedule plan (see below). A schedule plan describes a *strategy* for assigning schedules to participants. In the simplest case, every participant gets the same schedule (and thus the same scheduled activities); in more complex cases, researchers may assign users to different groups for A/B testing, or pursue other assignment strategies. A single schedule can be associated with more than one activity, if these activities should be grouped together. For example, you may have multiple activities in the A and B portion of an A/B test in order to co-vary the activities being assigned to a participant.

## Types of schedules

### Once

The simplest schedule generates an activity to be done one time, after an event occurs (usually enrollment). Once done, it will never be asked for again.

### Cron Schedules

A cron expression is a configuration string that describes times on a calendar, and allows for schedules such as "Mondays and Fridays at 8am" or "The first Thursday of every month at noon." The format of the cron expression is the seven field format as described in the [Java Quartz Scheduler](http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-1.x/tutorials/crontrigger) documentation (note that there are other formats that take up to eleven fields, this [online cron expression generator](http://www.cronmaker.com/) creates expressions in the right format). Although cron-based schedules are not super-useful for scheduling study tasks, if you need this kind of schedule, cron expressions are a tested and successful way of describing them.

For example, "Ask for this survey on Monday, Wednesday and Friday starting at 6am, and remove the request from the interface 6 hours later", would look like:

```json
{
   "scheduleType": "recurring",
   "cronTrigger": "0 0 6 ? * MON,WED,FRI *",
   "expires": "PT6H"
}
```

### Time intervals from an event

Alternatively, activities can be scheduled periodically from a specific event (such as the completion of a prior activity, or the date and time that a user enrolled in a study). In this scheme, activities are implicitly scheduled against the participant's study enrollment date if no other event is specified. This approach allows you to schedule tasks such as "wait 2 weeks after enrollment and then schedule a task every 3 days thereafter" or "assign a task one hour after taking a medication."

An interval of "P3D" and times of "07:00" and "15:00" mean: "starting with the date of enrollment, schedule this task every 3 days at 7am and 3pm."

```json
{
    "scheduleType": "recurring",
    "interval": "P3D",
    "times": ["07:00", "15:00"]
}
```

### Persistent activities

This form of activity is always in the user's list of scheduled activities. When the client updates the activity to indicate it is finished, a new one is immediately added to the list of scheduled activities. This useful for tasks such as "Send Us Feedback" if you wish to control this from the server.

## Available Task Events

The following events are currently available for scheduling (set them as the eventId of the schedule):

|Event|Event ID structure|Description|
|---|---|---|
|Enrollment|enrollment|The time that the user signs the consent to participate in researcher. This event is the default for a schedule if no other eventId is provided or found.|
|Activity finished|activity:&lt;GUID&gt;:finished|The time a scheduled activity is finished. This can be used to create recurring schedules where a task is issued N days after the same task was last performed.|
|2 weeks before enrollment|two\_weeks\_before_enrollment|Start schedule two weeks before enrollment. |
|2 months before enrollment|two\_months\_before_enrollment|Start schedule two months before enrollment. |

## Task scheduling logic

When scheduling a task, the scheduler does the following:

* The scheduler selects a starting date and time. This would be the enrollment date by default;
* If a delay has been specified, it is added to that timestamp;
* If a cron trigger is defined, it then finds the next valid time using the cron expression, from that timestamp;
* Otherwise, it creates a task on that day for each of the times specified in the schedule (times after the event). The scheduler then applies the interval to the last of these timestamps, and continues assigning on the next day.
* Once the start time for the task is determined, if the schedule has an expires duration, that is added to the start time to derive the end time of the task;
* If a startsOn or endsOn timestamp have been defined and the schedule's originating event is outside of this window, then no tasks are created. Similarly, in a recurring schedule, tasks won't be created after the `daysAhead` period specified in the request.
* The scheduler continues this way until one of two states are met. Either it creates tasks up to the time calculated from the request's `daysAhead` parameter, or it calculates the `minimumPerSchedule` activities for every schedule plan in the study, taking whichever value is 
larger for each schedule plan);

_You must set an expiration duration on repeating tasks._ Otherwise unfinished activities would stack up on each other during periods of inactivity, and the user would be presented with all of these activities at once.

## Schedule plans

When you create a schedule plan for users, you take one or more schedules and combine them with strategies for how to assign activities to participants using the schedules.

For example, you can divide study participants into a control and test group, and use different schedules to give them tasks with different frequencies.

Bridge has three strategies at the current time for creating schedule plans:

|Strategy|Description|
|---|---|
|SimpleScheduleStrategy|All users are scheduled with the same schedule, and get the same activities.|
|ABTestScheduleStrategy|Divide your participants by percentage into random groups, and use a different schedule for each group to assign activities. The combined set of groups should total 100%. After the initial assignment, new users joining the study will be randomly assigned to one of the groups in proportion to their percentage representation in the study.|
|CriteriaScheduleStrategy|The most flexible strategy, where each schedule is evaluated sequentially against a set of [Criteria](/model-browser.html#Criteria) and the first criteria that match a participant's request, that schedule is used to schedule activities for the participant. To assure a default schedule for participants who do not match any other criteria, you can include a last [ScheduleCriteria](/model-browser.html#ScheduleCriteria) object at the end of the list with no defined criteria.|
